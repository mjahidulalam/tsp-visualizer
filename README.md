# Traveling Salesperson Problem Visualizer
[Check out the web app](https://mjahidulalam.github.io/tsp-visualizer/)
<br/>

Web app created to help visualise algorithms used to solve the classic Traveling Salesperson problem. The following algorithms have been implemented so far:
- Nearest Neighbor
- Nearest Insertion
- Farthest Insertion
- 2-opt

I am curently working on adding more algorithms to the app.
